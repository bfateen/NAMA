# The N.A.M.A. Toolbox for AWS

The N.A.M.A. Toolbox will help you get started on AWS and validate your startup idea quickly, no matter what technical background you have.

N.A.M.A. stands for No-code + AI + Microservices + APIs.

Included are resources to quickly build the the following prototypes using CloudFormation templates, frontend code and backend Lambda function code:

1. The Waiting List prototype
2. The Wizard of Oz prototype
3. The Frankenstein prototype

Important: any resources created on your AWS account may potentially exceed your 'Free Tier' subscription, so don't forget to set up and monitor your billing alerts.

## The Waiting List prototype

The goal of this prototype is to create a basic landing page to collect private beta signups, to test demand in the market before building the MVP.

AWS Services utilized:

- S3
- Lambda
- DynamoDB
- API Gateway

## The Wizard of Oz prototype

The goal of this prototype is to simuate functionality manually first, to test the potential user experience before automating the functionality using code for the MVP.

## The Frankenstein prototype

The goal of this prototype is to test the technical feasibility of the core feature of the MVP first using a Microservice function, before building out the rest of the MVP.
