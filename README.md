# The N.A.M.A. Toolbox for AWS

If you're a startup founder in the early stages of validating your idea or if you are exploring Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the first time, you are in the right place!

The N.A.M.A. Toolbox will help you get started on AWS, no matter what background you have.

Included are the full templates, CloudFront scripts and code samples to help you build the most essential prototypes to validate your startup idea and become familiar with AWS:

1. The Waiting List prototype (aka Landing Page prototype)
2. The Wizard of Oz prototype
3. The Frankenstein prototype

We will deploy these prototypes quickly and easily using only services that are relevant to N.A.M.A. (No-code, AI (specifically Generative AI), Microservices and APIs).

For each prototype, the relevant frontend/backend code will be provided as well as CloudFront scripts that will automate the creation of resources on AWS. Important: any resources created on your AWS account may potentially exceed your 'Free Tier' subscription so please set up and monitor your billing alerts.
